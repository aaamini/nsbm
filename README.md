# The NSBM model 
*Nested stochastic block model (NSBM)*

This repository contains code supporting the following paper:
- [Nested stochastic block model for simultaneously clustering networks and nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09210), Nathaniel Josephs, Arash Amini, Marina Paez, and Lizhen Lin.

The code relies on the [`nett` package](https://github.com/aaamini/nett) for some of its functionality. 

How to use:
- Install the `nett` package from CRAN.
- Run the `all_banch.R` in the root of the repository to test if everything works.
```
